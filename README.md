Module 14 Challenge

There is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site. 

It catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) 
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The D3 library reads in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

A bubble chart that displays each sample.

A box displays the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Displays each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page

Updates all the plots when a new sample is selected.
